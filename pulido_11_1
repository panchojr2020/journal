I will add the batteries as soon as i finish everything
I will convert it to pcb when im all done
I dont feel like it reflects the time because for the longest time, we needed plywood, which we didnt have at the time, so we couldnt build it
I should have gotten the plywood earlier because if i had, I would have been done with the dog feeder
